Some theories, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), suggest that consciousness arises from complex neural processes in the brain, implying that it may not be possible for consciousness to exist independently of a physical body. However, other perspectives, including certain interpretations of quantum mechanics and some spiritual or religious beliefs, propose the possibility of consciousness existing as a fundamental, non-physical entity that can persist beyond the physical body.", "gemma2-9b-it": "This is a complex philosophical question with no definitive scientific answer."}}
